Problem 47: Distinct primes factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 22 × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19
Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?
