LCM

Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, given 4 and 6, return 12 because:

Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12 and so on.
Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18 and so on.
12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

    }
    return x;
