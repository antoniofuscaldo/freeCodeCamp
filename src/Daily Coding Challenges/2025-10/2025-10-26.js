/**

Duration Formatter

Given an integer number of seconds, return a string representing the same duration in the format "H:MM:SS", where "H" is the number of hours, "MM" is the number of minutes, and "SS" is the number of seconds. Return the time using the following rules:

Seconds: Should always be two digits.
Minutes: Should omit leading zeros when they aren't needed. Use "0" if the duration is less than one minute.
Hours: Should be included only if they're greater than zero.

*/

function format(seconds) {
  const h = Math.floor(seconds / 3600),
    m = Math.floor((seconds % 3600) / 60),
    s = (seconds % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  if (h > 0) return `${h}:${m.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${s}`;
  return `${m}:${s}`;
