/** 

Tic-Tac-Toe

Given a 3×3 matrix (an array of arrays) representing a completed Tic-Tac-Toe game, determine the winner.

Each element in the given matrix is either an "X" or "O".
A player wins if they have three of their characters in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Return:

"X wins" if player X has three in a row.
"O wins" if player O has three in a row.
"Draw" if no player has three in a row.
