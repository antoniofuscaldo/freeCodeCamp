/**

Invert a Binary Tree

Here will we create a function to invert a binary tree. Given a binary tree, we want to produce a new tree that is equivalently the mirror image of this tree. Running an inorder traversal on an inverted tree will explore the nodes in reverse order when compared to the inorder traversal of the original tree. Write a method to do this called invert on our binary tree. Calling this method should invert the current tree structure. Ideally, we would like to do this in-place in linear time. That is, we only visit each node once and we modify the existing tree structure as we go, without using any additional memory. Good luck!
